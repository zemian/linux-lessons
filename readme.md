## How to get Linux

One of the popular Linux distribution is called Ubuntu https://ubuntu.com/. It's easy to install and friendly to use. I recommend it for beginner if you want to install full Linux system on your machine.

However, if you already have a Non-Linux OS, and you still want to just learn Linux, then you may try one of the following:

* Docker - If you are running Windows or other non-Linux OS, the easiest way is to try https://www.docker.com/. See `docker.md` for more details.

* Virtual Machine - Try this https://www.virtualbox.org/

* Vagrant - A tool to automate Virtual Machines setup. https://www.vagrantup.com/

* GitBash For Windows - https://gitforwindows.org/ Note that this would only gives you a simulated Bash shell that has many "Linux like" commands. It is NOT a true Linux system.

NOTE: Because GitBash For Windows uses MinGW, it has more limited common Linux features such as "symbolic links" will not work there. To get that, you might want to try https://www.cygwin.com/ instead. But even Cygwin is only a simulated Linux system on Windows. But at least it gets you a very close environment to work with.
